<H2>531: Goodness Index</H2>
The goodness of fit index can be interpreted as the average correlation or information criterion between the cross-validated 
forecasts and observations for all series. (If the <A HREF="Options_Data_Transform.html">Transform Y Data</A> is on then the 
cross-validated correlation / information criterion is between the transformed forecasts and observations.) However, if the 
Pearson's or Spearman's correlation coefficient is used, rather than simply calculating an arithmetic average of the 
correlations, the correlations are first transformed to the Fisher z-scale, averaged, and then transformed back to the 
correlation scale (except in the case where any of the correlations are +/-1.0, in which case a simple average is calculated). 
The Fisher z-scale transform is used for Pearson's and Spearman's correlations because a simple average of these coefficients 
does not make mathematical sense for a variaety of reasons 
(<A HREF="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/1987-14534-001.html">Silver and Dunlap 1987</A>).<P>

The <B>Goodness Index</B> menu permits the user to change the score used to calculate the index. Since version 11, the default 
coefficient has been Kendall's correlation, but in prior versions Pearson's correlation was used. Since version 17, various
information criteria have been available; these criteria may be preferable when using one of the Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
options in CPT. (See <A HREF="Options_Regression.html">Regression Options</A> for further details on GLMs.

Kendall's correlation is set as the default because CPT then attempts to maximise the discriminatory power of the forecasts and 
is insensitive to the distribution of the data. However, if it is considered important to minimise the squared errors in the 
forecasts then Pearson's correlation may be a preferred option. Note that selecting Pearson's correlation when the 
<A HREF="Options_Data_Transform.html">Transform Y Data</A> is on is not generally to be recommended because it can result in 
Pearson's skill scores that are noticeably poorer than the goodness index might suggest. Similarly, if the Y data are not
normally distributed and the <A HREF="Options_Data_Transform.html">Transform Y Data</A> option is off and a GLM is not being
used the use of Kendall's or Spearman's correlation is recommended.<P>

If you elect to use one of the information criteria, in most cases the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is preferred over 
the Akaike (AIC), but the Mutual Information Criterion (MIC) may be most suitable when using CCA or PCR 
(<A HREF="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sta4.385">DelSole and Tippett 2021</A>).
